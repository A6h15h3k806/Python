These modules were inspired partly by the bordom, the oh so familar bordom, that seems to decorate the walks
that I often find myself obliged to take, and partly by my fascination (well..it's more of a heightened interest really)
with the primes. I'd often find myself scanning the registration plates of the vehicles that used to pass me by and
I'd make a resonablely good effort (as resonable good an effort as a bored pedestrian can make) to determine 
if the numbers in the registration plates were prime. This made me wonder how rare would it be for me to encounter
a "Prime Vehicle" and so these modules were made.

A registration plate would always have a number with four digits, so to find the probability of encountering a
"Prime Vehicle" we'd have to limit our attention to the primes less than 10,000. Using the Prime_Counter module
we find that there are exactly 1229 primes between the intervall 0 - 10,000 (including 0 and excluding 10,000 that is)
and we have 10,000 possible outcomes so this means that the probability of encountaring a "Prime Vehicle" was 
exactly 12.29 % or roughly 3 vehicles in a random selection of 25 are prime.
